Collection of TensorRTS bots

<ul>
  <li>Boom bot</li>
  + Boom bot tends to boom more than anything. This bot wins at like a 93% rate against most other bots I ran it against.
  <li>Frugal bot</li>
  + Frugal bot tries to rush when it can and advance. However, it will also look for large things around it. Also will boom if nothing else.
  <li>DQN "Feynman" Reinforcment Learning bot</li>
  + The DQN bot uses Deep Q Learning to train. It honestly really sucks.
